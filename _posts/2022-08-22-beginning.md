Circular thinking. A surreal architecture of places that were or will one day be real.

Writing in the form of a project changes things, externalises them, readies them to be percieved, even if they are to be percieved by an audience of zero. The fact of their potential perception retroactively posits a different flavour to them; a thread of meaning which is invisible from right in front but glistens in the sun if you catch it at an angle. That angle is your own. I will never know for whom or how the words have shone.

This project has no beginning. Read: I have to start somewhere, so start where you are. For now I concede to the web, and place things in it. The web is sticky so they stay where I put them.

No one is looking. Is it safe to come out?
